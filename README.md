> "So, you're a craftsman? As any craftsman you need your own toolbelt."

*The **Toolbelt** library is just a set of utilities and classes extracted from popular libraries like **Guava, Apache Commons, etc**.*

All this library and idea is inspired on on **Fernando Cejas**'s [Arrow library](https://github.com/android10/arrow).

Why not fork it and make a pull request to Fernando's library? Basically because i added some tools and classes, that i use in my daily work and i think they won't fit well in the original library.

All of 3rd party classes keep the original license header.
